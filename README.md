# User Interface Project II: Great Idea Web Page With Flexbox

Now that you have experienced building a layout using `inline-block`.  Lets revisit the same HTML structure and refactor our first page with flex box module.  If you didn't finish yesterday's assignment, just start from scratch or use the solution code provided to you.

Once you have finished the home page using flex box module, go build the services page based on the [design file](design-files/services-desktop-design.png) provided to you.  This time you will need to structure your own HTML in addition to using flex box module.  You have been provided all the necessary images in the `img` folder.

## Objectives

* [x] Home Page Refactor:
  * Note that the provided HTML is blank.  This is because I want you to use your code from yesterday if possible.  If you didn't finish, that's fine, just use the solution from yesterday
  * Refactor the home page layout with flexbox where `inline-block` was used before.
  * In your navigation elements, point the services `<a href=""></a>` to `services.html`

* [x] Services Page Build:
  * Update the title in your newly copied services page to say `Great Idea! - Services`
  * Using the provided [design file](design-files/services-desktop-design.png), create the services page layout using flexbox and box model.
  * Wrap the great idea logo in an anchor tag and point the `href` to `index.html`

## Part Two:
Go back and follow the same steps for your [UI-III-Flexbox project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/UI-III-Flexbox) and your [User Interface - Great Idea Project](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/User-Interface).

In order to do this, you **do not** need to create new forks of these projects. Follow the steps below for each project:

- [x] Add your PM as a collaborator to your fork. 
- [x] Go into your project folder, make a new branch `firstname-lastname`
- [x] Add your first and last name to the README.md file in the project and save.
- [x] add/commit/and push to your own branch  **Be sure to push to your branch!**
- [x] Create a Pull-Request to submit your work
  - [x] Use your own student fork as the base (compare across forks, base-fork -> master).
  - [x] Add your PM as a reviewer on the Pull-Request
- [x] PM then will count the Assignment as done by merging the HW back into master "STUDENT FORK".
